# Hotel Booking Web Application

Welcome to our Hotel Booking Web Application! This project aims to revolutionize the way users experience hotel accommodation booking. Here are five standout features that make our platform unique:

## 1. Stunning Imagery with Parallax Scrolling

Immerse users in a visually captivating experience with high-quality images and videos showcasing our hotel rooms and amenities. The use of parallax scrolling adds an extra layer of dynamism, making the homepage a feast for the eyes.

## 2. User Authentication with Firebase and JWT

Ensuring a secure and seamless user experience, our platform allows users to create accounts using email/password or log in seamlessly with Google authentication via Firebase. The implementation of JSON Web Tokens (JWT) enhances security, creating a secure environment for both email/password-based authentication and social login.

## 3. Responsive Design for Any Device

Our commitment to accessibility is reflected in our responsive design, ensuring a smooth and enjoyable user experience across all devicesâ€”be it mobile, tablet, or desktop. Whether you're on the go or relaxing at home, our website adapts to your screen size seamlessly.

## 4. Booking Management with Cancellation and Date Update

Empowering users with control over their bookings, our platform allows hassle-free cancellations up to one day before the booked date. Additionally, users can easily update their booking dates, providing flexibility to accommodate changes in their plans.

## 5. Dynamic Room Details and Review System

Delve into the specifics of each room with our detailed Room Details Page. Users can view room descriptions, prices, sizes, availability, and special offers. The integrated review system encourages authentic user feedback, creating a community-driven space for sharing experiences.

### Struggles Encountered

While developing this project, I faced a few challenges that contributed to my learning journey:

1. **Fetching Data:**
   - Fetching and managing data from the server proved to be a significant hurdle. Understanding the intricacies of asynchronous operations and ensuring data consistency across various components required dedicated effort.

2. **Creating Dynamic URLs:**
   - Generating dynamic URLs for specific pages, especially when dealing with room details and user bookings, posed a challenge. Ensuring a clean and user-friendly URL structure while dynamically handling content was a valuable but demanding experience.

3. **JWT Implementation:**
   - Integrating JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for user authentication and secure data transmission presented a learning curve. Understanding the token lifecycle, implementing token creation, storage, and verification on both the client and server sides required meticulous attention to security details.
